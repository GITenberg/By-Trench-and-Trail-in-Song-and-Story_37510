<h2>INTRODUCTION.</h2>


<p>A number of the songs in this collection have
been heard by campfire and trail from the camps
of British Columbia to the lumber camps of Maine.
Several of the songs have been fired at the Huns
"somewhere in France," no doubt with deadly
effect. And also at the Turks on the long long hike
to Bagdad and beyond.</p>

<p>And it is not impossible that some of my countrymen
are now warbling snatches of my humble verse
to the accompaniment of bagpipes on the streets of
the New Jerusalem! Many of the verses have
appeared from time to time in leading publications
from Vancouver, B. C., to the New England States
and Eastern Canada; while others appear in print
here for the first time.</p>

<p>From all parts of the land I have received letters
at various times asking for extra copies of some
particular song in my humble collection, which I
was not in a position to supply at the time.</p>

<p>I therefore decided to publish some of the songs
for which a demand had been expressed, and in so
doing offer to the reading public in extenuation of
my offense the plea that in a manner this humble
volume is being published by request.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span></p>

<p>I offer no apology for my "dialect" songs as they
have already received the approval of music lovers
whose judgment is beyond criticism.</p>

<p>For the errors which must inevitably creep into
the work of a non-college-bred lumberjack, I crave
the indulgence of all highbrows who may resent my
inability to comb the classics for copy to please
them. All the merit I can claim is the ability to
rhyme a limerick or sing a "come-all-ye" in a manner
perhaps not unpleasing to my friends.</p>

<p>The lumberjacks will understand me, I am sure,
and will appreciate my humble efforts to entertain
them.</p>

<p>As for the genial highbrow, should he deem me
an interloper in the realm of letters and imagine that
my wild, uncultured notes are destroying the harmony
of his supersensitive soul, I shall "lope" back
to the tall timber again and seek sympathy and
appreciation among the lumberjacks of the forest
primeval, where, amid the wild surroundings and the
crooning of the trees, there is health for mind and
body borne on every passing breeze. Yes, there's
something strangely healing in the magic of the
myrrh, in the odor of the cedar and the fragrance
of the fir.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span></p>

<p>There the hardy lumberjack is the undisputed
lord of the lowlands and chief of the highlands, and
at the present time no soldier in the trenches or
sailor on the rolling deep has a more arduous task
to perform or a more important duty to discharge
than he.</p>

<p>Toil on, ye Titans of the tall timbers; steadfast
soldiers of the saw, and able allies of the axe. Carry
on till the stately trees which constitute the glory of
the West are converted into ships and planes in
countless thousands, to win the great war for freedom
and to make the world safe for democracy&mdash;and
lumberjacks!</p>

There's a strong, strong army moulding<br />

There's a world-wide movement holding<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Firm the lines of our destiny:</span><br />
And 'twill never cease<br />

<h2>THE SONS OF OUR MOTHERS</h2>


<div class='poem'>
<span style="margin-left: 3em;">In the Ramah's of our day</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 3em;">Mothers grieve their hearts away,</span><br />
Mourning comfortless as Rachel did of yore;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 3em;">Hoping day by day to learn</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 3em;">Of their absent boy's return</span><br />
And to hear his well-known footsteps at the door.<br />
The lilies are blooming in far-away France&mdash;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 7em;">Bloom O bloom!</span><br />
The cannons are roaring retreat and advance&mdash;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 7em;">Boom, O boom!</span><br />
The hell of their fire is falling like rain,<br />
And our soldiers before it are falling like grain,<br />
While the voices of loved ones are calling in vain&mdash;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 7em;">Home, sweet home!</span><br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 3em;">Dear Canadians who fell,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 3em;">Fighting nobly fighting well,</span><br />
May the angels guard thy rest in lonely graves;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 3em;">We'll remember "ridge" and "hill"</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 3em;">And rejoice in knowing, still,</span><br />
That the dear old flag you died for rules the waves.<br />
The wild birds are lilting their lay on the breeze,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 7em;">Soft and low:</span><br />
As they croon to their nestlings asway in the trees,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 7em;">To and fro&mdash;</span><br />
The young of the robin will flit down the glen<br />
And return in the spring to the dwellings of men,<br />
But the sons of our mothers return not again&mdash;<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span><span style="margin-left: 7em;">No, ah no!</span><br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 3em;">And the absent from the fold?</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 3em;">What of those, the gay, the bold?</span><br />
Fighting bravely, dying nobly, to the fore.<br />
<span style="margin-left: 3em;">Shall we not avenge the slain?</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 3em;">Shall our mothers weep in vain?</span><br />
Calling, calling for the boys who come no more.<br />
Dear soldier boys dead in the trenches of war,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 7em;">Work well done!</span><br />
Your service for country there's nothing can mar,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 7em;">Fame well won!</span><br />
They fought for the right in a cause that will win&mdash;<br />
They died in a fight that they did not begin&mdash;<br />
And you'll pay the last groat when we enter Berlin.<br />
<span style="margin-left: 7em;">Hun, oh Hun!</span><br />

<h2>CHRISTMAS IN QUEBEC.</h2>


<div class="blockquot"><p>This sketch is truer of the Quebec of last century than
that of today. I am glad to hear that whisky blanc does
not "cut the figure" in French festivities now that it did
twenty years ago; and no one will rejoice more than Oscar
Dhu to see the demon rum utterly destroyed in Canada ere
many moons.</p>

<p>Yes, I sincerely hope that the day will soon dawn when
the baneful influence of both De Kuyper and de Kaiser will
be forever banished from my dear native province, queenly
Quebec!</p></div>

<h2>"THE CLEVELAND MESSAGE."</h2>


<div class="blockquot"><p>The seeming hostile spirit towards the United States pervading
some of the sketches in this volume is more apparent
than real, as they were introduced in the spirit of fun to
accentuate the oddities of certain characters, and not to
disparage our neighbor; for notwithstanding petty quarrels
and misunderstandings we always loved our great big, bluff
brother to the South.</p>

<p>We always maintained that closer relationship with our
kindred people was our manifest destiny and that nothing
could happen that would keep us permanently apart.
According to this song, written many years ago, we have
been "interwooing" and "intermarrying" for a long time.
We have been flocking to their cities and they have been
flocking to our farms, and naturally the ties between us
have been growing stronger with the years.</p>

<p>Consequently when the present great war engulfed the
world in a holocaust of blood, kindred cried to kindred and
the resulting alliance was both natural and logical.</p>

<p>Time alone can prove the value of the services rendered
the Allied cause in this great war by British Americans and
Americanadians residing in the United States.</p>

<p>The Germans and pro-Germans of this country thot in
their overweening pride with overbearing Kultur to obtain
a greater "pull" with Uncle Sam than we possessed. By
the most cunning propaganda ever known they endeavored
to widen the breach between brother Jonathan and John
Bull, but failed miserably. While they "hoched" for the
"fatherland" till the cows came home, we "coached" for
the "motherland" till the children came home!</p>

<p>Kultur may be a powerful persuader but the call of the
blood is more powerful still, and when the old lion roared
his appeal the sound went round the world, and the whelps,
true to their breed, gathered from all corners of the earth,
not into alien jungles, but home! The fur is now flying and
blood is flowing, and when the combatants shall have
emerged from the great conflict the two powerful branches
of the English-speaking peoples will be bound together in
ties of friendship stronger than ever before, and by thunder
they will not be under!</p></div><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span></p>


<h2>THE CLEVELAND MESSAGE<br />

or<br />

HOW CANADA AND THE U. S.<br />
MAY BECOME ONE.</h2>

<div class='poem'>
It is such a fad at present<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">For each poet effervescent,</span><br />
To assail the "cross" or "crescent"<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And the "Cleveland message" grim;</span><br />
That we pondered for a minute<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Thinking we would not be "in it"</span><br />
If we did not aid some Linnet<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">With a little of our din.</span><br />
<br />
Now we're not at'all unwilling<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">To receive a course of "drilling"</span><br />
If successful in dispelling<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Just a little of the mist</span><br />
Which is hanging thickly over<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Our detractor, brother Grover,</span><br />
And that rank sedition mover,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Called the jingo journalist.</span><br />
<br />
There are men among you moving<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Who're ostensibly peace loving,</span><br />
While their conduct's always proving<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">The reverse to be their toast;</span><br />
They eternally are blowing<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Like a game cock, bent on showing</span><br />
By his loud defiant crowing<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span><span style="margin-left: 1em;">That he's there to rule the roost!</span><br />
<br />
Tho' you send a warlike "message"<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Do not punctuate its passage</span><br />
Crying "cut 'em into sassage,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Now beware, you crippled cuss":</span><br />
All such ravings out of season<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Should be classified as treason,</span><br />
Guard your tongues and use your reason<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">In considering the "fuss."</span><br />
<br />
If again your mind should rove<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Around the field of Carnage Grover,</span><br />
We would have you think it over<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">In the light of common sense;</span><br />
Ponder well the pain and labor<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">It would cause to quell your neighbor;</span><br />
And be sure you hide your saber<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">'Ere you venture through our fence.</span><br />
<br />
Why rely on jingo blowing<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">If you're bent upon subduing</span><br />
Brave Canadians who've been growing<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Since they met Montgomery?</span><br />
Drop your systematic hounding,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And your epithets loud sounding</span><br />
For we've pipers here abounding<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Who could blow you out to sea!</span><br />
<br />
If you saw bold piper Ronald<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Of the warlike Clan Macdonald,</span><br />
And the way in which he pommelled<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">O'er a hundred of your ranks;</span><br />
You would soon be after wishing<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">You had always kept a-fishing</span><br />
Right at home, instead of swishing<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Warlines over Britain's banks!</span><br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span><br />
And it seems to us so very<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Queer that Highlanders who quarry</span><br />
Monumental stones at Barre,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Did not scare away your frowns:</span><br />
Had they started with their hammers<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Down among your city bummers,</span><br />
It would take you many summers<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">To repopulate your towns.</span><br />
<br />
Yea, at prospects of a battle<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">From old Bangor to Seattle</span><br />
Each Canadian would skedaddle<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">To defend his home and kin;</span><br />
And from Picton to Vancouver<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">We would welcome each one over;</span><br />
Thus united, brother Grover,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Would you have a chance to win?</span><br />
<br />
Then relinquish Yankee dodges,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">We would warn you to be cautious;</span><br />
Silence rabid Cabot Lodges<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And your jingo journalists.</span><br />
Friendship's thread already slender<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Needs a sapient defender&mdash;</span><br />
As the lion's tail is tender<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">From so many ruthless twists!</span><br />
<br />
We have often heard it stated<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">When by jingoists berated,</span><br />
That the people here were fated<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">To be "taken in by Sam."</span><br />
But believe us, brother Grover,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Coming ages will discover</span><br />
That you cannot get us over<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">In that manner by a d&mdash;&mdash;!</span><br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span><br />
There's another way that's better<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Than coercion and the fetter,</span><br />
And we'll tell you in this letter<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">How to circumvent the end:</span><br />
Cultivate a better feeling<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">For your neighbor in your dealing&mdash;</span><br />
As you'll never see us kneeling<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">For the favors you can lend.</span><br />
<br />
Let events their course pursuing<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Glide along as they've been doing&mdash;</span><br />
Let our people interwooing&mdash;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Intermarry&mdash;buy and sell;</span><br />
Let your friendly salutation,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Be extended to this nation,</span><br />
Let the law of gravitation<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Do the rest and all is well!</span><br />
<br />
You have often sold a daughter<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">To some dude across the water,</span><br />
While the title high(?) which bought her<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">You so seemingly ignore;</span><br />
Why not send us a cotillion<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Of those girls who own a million</span><br />
For our hardy northern gillian<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">On the old Canadian shore?</span><br />
<br />
You may think this would not do, but<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">We can tell you that your "blue blood"</span><br />
Isn't "in it" with the true blood<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Of our bracing Northern clime&mdash;</span><br />
Better far to take their chances<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">With Xavier at Lac St. Francis</span><br />
Than to purchase the advances<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Of coin hunters of our time!</span><br />

<h2>THE SULTAN AT THE KAISER'S KOURT</h2>

<div class='center'><b>Enter<br />
SECOND SONS</b><br />
&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;</div>

<div class='poem'><br />
Mohammed Dammed, gift of God!<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">The Sultan's second son,</span><br />
Enjoys a pilgrimage abroad<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">With Eitel Fritz the Hun.</span><br />
<br />
These second sons, of sons of guns,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Are sure some friendly foes;</span><br />
But to what length their friendship runs<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Jehovah only knows.</span><br />
<br />
Just now the Sultan, also, dines<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">At Williams' kultured kourt,</span><br />
And downs the Kaiser's doctored wines<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">While Kaiser downs his porte.</span><br />
<br />
One day young Dammed said to Fritz:<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">"Who started this fool row?</span><br />
Whoever did was void of wits,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">As you must know by now."</span><br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span><br />
Said Eitel, "Though I'm from Missour,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Some say it was my Dad;</span><br />
But as they're going to Bag-dad sure,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">He'll wish he never had."</span><br />
<br />
Said Dammed, "If they bag your Dad<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">They'll bag my Daddy sure,</span><br />
And make him wish he never had<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Come here to seek a cure.</span><br />
<br />
"Your father promised mine to win<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">From Cork to Timbuctoo;</span><br />
If we would throw our Turkey in<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Your bloody Pots-dam brew!</span><br />
<br />
"Besides, he promised on demand<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Star-eyed Parisian pearls!</span><br />
Great hunks of Greece, Manhattan and<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">A thousand chorus girls!</span><br />
<br />
"He also swore by every beard<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">The prophets ever tore,</span><br />
That great Mahomet had appeared<br />

<div class='poem'>
I will write a short sketch<br />
Of that free hearted wretch<br />
Whom all fakirs delight to espy.<br />
He is seen every day<br />
Just below Yesler Way,<br />
Either "full" or distressingly "dry".<br />
<br />
He alights from the train,<br />
Or a boat from the main,<br />
With intentions both honest and clear.<br />
But the weak-minded wight,<br />
Led astray before night,<br />
Is filled full of doped whiskey and beer.<br />
<br />
How alluring and bright<br />
Is each glittering light,<br />
As he joyfully watches the throng;<br />
And his spirits are gay<br />
As a bird's are in May,<br />
And as gayly conducive to song.<br />
<br />
How seductive the speech<br />
In which sirens beseech<br />
Him to share the delights of their spree.<br />
Ev'ry man in the set<br />
Is "hail fellow well met",<br />
And each woman delightfully free!<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span><br />
There's a wink from the "traps",<br />
And a meal with the Japs,<br />
And a shuffle of cards as they go.<br />
There's a trip to the play,<br />
A few "smiles" by the way,<br />
And a box by themselves at the show.<br />
<br />
O how slyly they wink<br />
As they sip at their drink,<br />
And maliciously help him to his;<br />
And he drinks it, alas!<br />
'Though the foam on the glass<br />
Floats around with a death-dealing fizz.<br />
<br />
Thus the night passes by<br />
Till the victimized "guy"<br />
Is sufficiently "doped" to "go through";<br />
And the stupefied lout,<br />
When he's finally out,<br />
Will possess but a nickel or two.<br />
<br />
Wholly drunk, and half blind,<br />
With confusion of mind,<br />
And to rum-selling vultures a prey,<br />
He is found at the "Mug"&mdash;<br />
Takes a ride to the jug,<br />
And there slumbers his potions away.<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span><br />
Coming out the next morn,<br />
Sober, sick and forlorn,<br />
To a world that has quickly grown cold!<br />
A poor outcast he roams<br />
While in sumptuous homes<br />
Whilom friends(?) are enjoying his gold.<br />
<br />
Where is now the glib friend<br />
Of his bounty to lend<br />
The poor devil the price of a plate?<br />
He has vanished like mist<br />
Of the morning, sun-kissed&mdash;<br />
And the victim is left to his fate.<br />
<br />
Not a wink from a lass,<br />
Nor a clink from a glass,<br />
With "your health", as it's borne to the lips;<br />
Not a sign from a trap,<br />
Not a bite from a Jap&mdash;<br />
All his sunshine has suffered eclipse!<br />
<br />
Not a kindly "invite"<br />
From the friends of the night,<br />
To "step in and have something on me."<br />
Not a drop from the fakes<br />
Just to steady the shakes,<br />
And to "knock" the effects of the spree.<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span><br />
As he wanders the street<br />
Not one friend does he meet,<br />
Not a soul that will greet him today;<br />
"Broke" and hungry&mdash;alone,<br />
With a heartrending moan,<br />
He must totter along to the bay.<br />
<br />
O, the groans which now surge<br />
With the tones of a dirge<br />
From that soul so late given to song,<br />
And how scenes long since fled<br />
Like a wail from the dead,<br />
Rise to hasten his footsteps along.<br />
<br />
Yea, dim memories rush<br />
To his mind, and a flush<br />
Of deep shame drives all pallor away,<br />
As he thinks of the East<br />
And the home he has lost<br />
By the life that leads on to the bay.<br />
<br />
"Robbed and wronged all around,"<br />
Is the sob of the sound,<br />
But no mortal comes forward to save;<br />
So with mutterings of wrath<br />
He goes down to his death<br />
Through the green, clammy depths of the waves.<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span><br />
Hark the tones of despair<br />
Which arise on the air<br />
From the shades of the low moaning bay;<br />
They will float through the years<br />
And encircle the spheres,<br />
And be heard at the great Judgment Day.<br />
<br />
Soon a poor, bloated form,<br />
Tossed about by the storm,<br />
Floating 'round on the crest of each wave,<br />
With seaweed for a shroud,<br />
Is beheld by the crowd,<br />
And a failure is borne to his grave.<br />
<br />
'Tis a jump from the train<br />
And a trip up on <a name="FNanchor_A_1" id="FNanchor_A_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_A_1" class="fnanchor">[A]</a>Main,<br />
And a sip with a friend (?) on the way.<br />
Just a step to the "Mug",<br />
And a ride to the "jug"&mdash;<br />
Then a leap to his death in the bay.<br />
<br />
But the Lord from his seat<br />
Looketh down on each street,<br />
Where such hell-born inventions are on,<br />
And with infinite wrath<br />
He will sweep on their path&mdash;<br />
And they'll reap on that day what they've sown.<br />

<h2>THE GRIPPE</h2>


<div class='poem'>
To see us now, deceivers<br />
Would say this land of beavers<br />
Was full of fitful fevers<br />
<span style="margin-left: 4em;">And other chills.</span><br />
On all the passing breezes<br />
There's nothing heard but wheezes,<br />
With hacking coughs and sneezes,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 4em;">And other ills.</span><br />
<br />
The bear, that northern prowler,<br />
The 'Oonalaska howler,<br />
And every other growler<br />
<span style="margin-left: 4em;">We read about,</span><br />
With us have caught the churning<br />
Whose cause is past discerning,<br />
The demon that is turning<br />
<span style="margin-left: 4em;">Us inside out.</span><br />
<br />
The monster's exultation<br />
Is heard throughout the nation,<br />
He stops at every station<br />
<span style="margin-left: 4em;">To spread himself;</span><br />
And no one can avoid him,<br />
'Tis useless to deride him,<br />
Impossible to hide him<br />
<span style="margin-left: 4em;">Upon a shelf.</span><br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span><br />
Whence come those sudden changes,<br />
With all their train of twinges,<br />
Grim foes of health that hinges<br />
<span style="margin-left: 4em;">On atmosphere?</span><br />
There surely is a reason<br />
For this fantastic season,<br />
That sets the world a sneezin'<br />
<span style="margin-left: 4em;">About us here.</span><br />
<br />
This "rushing" influenza,<br />
Just taken for a mensa,<br />
Most certainly will cleanse a'<br />
<span style="margin-left: 4em;">Your system, man.</span><br />
It has the knack to stick, too&mdash;<br />
'Twould surely turn "Old Nick" blue<br />
And draw his toenails quick through<br />
<span style="margin-left: 4em;">His diaphragm.</span><br />
<br />
No power can avail, man,<br />
To drive him from the trail, man;<br />
The patent drugs for sale man,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 4em;">Can never cure.</span><br />
He comes against your will, man,<br />
And sneaks around to kill, man;<br />
The rippling of his rill, man,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 4em;">Is never pure.</span><br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span><br />
It droppeth like the rain, man,<br />
Extracted by the pain, man,<br />
And driveth one insane, man,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 4em;">To think of it.</span><br />
It robs us of our food, man,<br />
And freezes up our blood, man&mdash;<br />
And sleep! Nary a nod, man,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 4em;">Or wink of it.</span><br />
<br />
The old world it's been tearing&mdash;<br />
Now we must have a hearing;<br />
It crossed the strait of Behring&mdash;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 4em;">Yes, bound to win.</span><br />
Ah! now it overtakes me,<br />
The shivering that shakes me<br />
Is one that surely makes the<br />
<span style="margin-left: 4em;">Whole world akin.</span><br />
<br />
Across from coast to coast, sir,<br />
You wander like a ghost, sir;<br />
Every one can boast(?), sir,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 4em;">Of having you.</span><br />
You strike at high and lowly,<br />
The wicked and the holy,<br />
The poor, and they who roll thee,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 4em;">Fifth avenue!</span><br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span><br />
No doubt our friend bold "Fairman",<br />
And also John his chairman,<br />
Are pulling out their hair (?), man,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 4em;">And looking wild.</span><br />
If influenza has them,<br />
My writing will not please them;<br />
So, Oscar, pray don't tease them<br />
<span style="margin-left: 4em;">Or get them riled.</span><br />
<br />
Gu'tchew! gu'tchew! gu'tchew! man;<br />

<h2>THE END OF THE TRAIL</h2>


<div class='poem'>
I was summoned in the gloaming to the bedside of a friend<br />
Who was passing through the shadows ever lurking at the end:<br />
To the bedside of a comrade I had known long, long ago<br />
Back in dear old Compton County, where the sugar maples grow.<br />
Just a simple son of Lewis, careless, fearless, poor and proud,<br />
As becomes a Highland Scotsman of the royal clan MacLeod.<br />
He could sing the songs of loveland, as I've seldom heard them sung&mdash;<br />
Richest treasures of the Highlands flowed in music from his tongue.<br />
What a privilege and pleasure to have heard him in his prime,<br />
Ere his mellow notes were burdened by the cruel strains of time.<br />
When the gentle nurse had brought me to the couch of poor old John<br />
E'en a novice would not question that his race was nearly run.<br />
He was lonely in the city, longing for the spruce and pine,<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span>And his eyes grew bright with pleasure as he placed his hand in mine,<br />
Saying: "Don't forget me, Angus, but come out to see me here,<br />
For the nights are long and lonely, and the days devoid of cheer.<br />
Yes, I know my days are numbered, all the signs to me are plain:<br />
I shall never guide the movements of the skid road boys again.<br />
There's a secret I would tell you that I've never told before,<br />
It was locked up in my bosom fifty years ago or more:<br />
It's of Mary, gentle Mary, whom I loved in years agone&mdash;<br />
Loved her then and will forever, and my Mary loved her John!<br />
But there came another wooer, who was rich as I was poor,<br />
And her parents looked with favor on this keeper of a store.<br />
I was wounded, yes, and angry, that their greed should thus deny<br />
Me the place they held for riches, so I bade them all good bye,<br />
And I left my Mary weeping, though she begged of me to stay&mdash;<br />
Left her weeping&mdash;to my sorrow&mdash;and I westward took my way.<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span>Then I drifted hither, thither, like the flotsam of the sea:<br />
Every year a little farther from my home in Tallabharee,<br />
Till at last I came to anchor on the shores of Puget Sound,<br />
Where so many of my comrades in misfortune may be found."<br />
Here his speech grew slow and halting, as he said, amid his groans,<br />
He had feared for what might happen to his "poor old aching bones."<br />
"Do not let them sink my body where the derelicts are thrown,<br />
For although I'm poor in pocket, pride was bred within my bone.<br />
When my limbs refuse their burden and I cannot further go,<br />
And the trail is dark and tangled where the fir and cedars grow;<br />
When the cord of life is severed and in death I'm lying low,<br />
And there's nothing left but tallabh of the John you used to know:<br />
Lay me down amid the shadows of the forest that I love,<br />
With the grey green moss around me and the skies of God above;<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span>Where no noises will disturb me save the whisper of the woods<br />
And the night-birds' dismal hooting in the primal solitudes,<br />
Where the crooning voice of nature chants the glory of the West,<br />
Let the groves of God hold vigil o'er my everlasting rest.<br />
Over there beyond the shadows I will find my Mary dear,<br />
And we'll cruise the trails together that we missed so sadly here."<br />
When again I looked upon him death had wrapped him in its chill,<br />
Songs were silenced now forever and the lilting lips were still.<br />

<h2>SERGEANT MAJOR LARRY<br />
OF THE GALLANT 58TH</h2>

<div class="blockquot"><p>In '96 the author served his Queen for two weeks on
the plains of Rockland, near Richmond, Que., as orderly
under the gallant Capt. Peter Gillies, now of Bury, P. Q.
One of the subordinate officers becoming the butt of his
comrades owing to unpopular tactics the following "Come-allye"
resulted. The author may add that this "drill" ended
his military career&mdash;he hasn't been orderly since.</p></div>

<div class='center'><br />
&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;</div>
<div class='poem'><br />
O come all ye loyal volunteers,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">You're ordered for review:</span><br />
Keep your eyes on Sergeant Larry<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Of the famous "No. 2".</span><br />
He's the model of a soldier,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And 'tis worth your while to watch</span><br />
How he handles the maneuvers<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">In his drill among the Scotch.</span><br />
<br />
Sure his "honors" sought him early,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">He was here but half a week,</span><br />
When the call came: "Forward, Larry,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">You're promoted for your cheek:</span><br />
Take your stripes and stand for orders<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And reveal to No. 2</span><br />
What a mixture of conceit and gall,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">With brass and cheek, can do."</span><br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span><br />
And the "orders" are "Fall in, my men,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Look sharp, and don't be late!</span><br />
Signed, Sergeant Major Larry,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Of the gallant 58."</span><br />
Come, my boys, you need not grumble,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">You have but to grin and yield,</span><br />
For brave Kitchener's "not in it"<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">When bold Larry's on the field.</span><br />
<br />
When we started down from Scotstown<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">We were just as big as him,</span><br />
But his honors won so quickly<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Made the rest of us look slim.</span><br />
O, he swelled in regimentals<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Till he quite outgrew his tent,</span><br />
But he'll get the one he asked for<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">When old Hogan pays his rent.</span><br />
<br />
O we are loyal volunteers,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Our red coats prove us so,</span><br />
We are ready, aye, and willing now<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">To meet our country's foe.</span><br />
Who would not be proud of Canada<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And for her sake to bleed?</span><br />
For success would crown our efforts<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">If bold Larry took the lead.</span><br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span><br />
Yes, the sword that dangles by his side's<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">A borrowed one, I know</span><br />
But it matters not to Larry,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">As it helps to make a show!</span><br />
See him strut around the camp ground,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Like a peacock in the grass!</span><br />
And the "staff" will send him higher<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">When it needs a boom in brass.</span><br />
<br />
Such was Larry bold&mdash;in peace time&mdash;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">He was brave as Lochinvar,</span><br />
But he quickly changed his music<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">As the bugle called for war;</span><br />
When the Highlanders grew wrathy,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">With their hair straight up on end,</span><br />
Sergeant Larry dropped at Bury,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">As he wished to see a friend!</span><br />
<br />
We were left without a leader<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And the riot louder swelled,</span><br />
Divers Scotsmen drew their bayonets<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And for blood they madly yelled.</span><br />
Ev'ry car was full of soldiers,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Noisy as salvation drum,</span><br />
On the day we left Camp Rockland<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And the troops came shouting home.</span><br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span><br />
After Larry comes the "Colonel,"<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And a valiant man is he,</span><br />
Tho' he never led his forces<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">From "Atlanta to the sea";</span><br />
Yet, if e'er the country needs him,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Every clansman will awake,</span><br />
From old Hampton down to Weedon<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And from Lingwick to the Lake.</span><br />
<br />
We will conquer with our music<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">If our fighting fails to win,</span><br />
Whom bold Larry cannot vanquish<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">We will silence with our din;</span><br />
Thus we'll proudly march to glory<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And in midst of all the fray</span><br />
We'll be cheered by French of Scotstown<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">As he whistles "Cabar Faidth."</span><br />
<br />
And McLennan with his bagpipes,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">He's a brass band in himself,</span><br />
We will have him with his music<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">To conjure the fighting elf.</span><br />
There is nothing so inspiring<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">As a loyal tune or song,</span><br />
To arouse a soldier's spirits<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And to cheer the "boys" along.</span><br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span><br />
We will have them there from Scotstown,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">From Ben gal and Echo Vale,</span><br />
Men imbued with faith and courage,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Highland traits which never fail;</span><br />
And to swell the fighting faction<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">We've the twins of Murray's Clan,</span><br />
Who can fight their weight in wildcats&mdash;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Not to mention mortal man!</span><br />
<br />
And we've armies to fall back on,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Whose supply will never fail,</span><br />
Troops which cross the wild Atlantic<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">On all ships of steam or sail;</span><br />
You will find them throughout Canada,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Wherever you may roam,</span><br />
And the natives call them "home boys",<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">For they never stop at home.</span><br />
</div>


<div class='center'><br />Chorus<br /><br /></div>

<div class='poem'>
Beat the drums and blow the bugle, boys,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And whoop it all you're worth,</span><br />
As a token to the nations<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">You are rulers of the earth!</span><br />
If you wish to shine as soldiers<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">You must all be up to date,</span><br />
And uphold the reputation<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Of Battalion 58.</span><br />

<h2>A LEAP-YEAR BALL AT LINGWICK<br />
&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;</h2>


<div class='poem'>
The night before last Hallowe'en<br />
Tho' wet as any ever seen,<br />
Must henceforth mark a date supreme<br />
In Lingwick's social lore.<br />
As on that eve the ladies all<br />
Came forth to give their leap-year ball&mdash;<br />
And long ere ten the dancing hall<br />
Was crowded to the door.<br />
<br />
Since Scottish heroes sang duans<br />
Upon the field of Prestonpans,<br />
So fine a gathering of the clans<br />
Was surely never seen.<br />
And brilliant Byron's "ladies fair"<br />
Who danced in Belgium's balmy air<br />
Could never with our girls compare<br />
In beauty's realm, I ween.<br />
<br />
Were I a Burns I'd sing their praise<br />
In grateful sympathetic lays,<br />
And tell them how a bard repays<br />
The smiles on him bestowed.<br />
O! for a pure poetic drift,<br />
Or bard McRitchie's splendid gift,<br />
To give those charming girls a lift<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span>On chummy Hymen's road.<br />
<br />
Since first the red man trod those lands,<br />
In happy, reckless, roving bands,<br />
Where now the town of Lingwick stands,<br />
Until the present time.<br />
No festal scene deserved such note,<br />
Of such a scene no poet wrote,<br />
Tho' painted with a double coat<br />
Of stirring prose or rhyme.<br />
<br />
The lively Galson girls were there,<br />
With dancing eyes and wavy hair,<br />
And roses stamped by caller air<br />
On every blooming cheek.<br />
And other ladies, fair and bright,<br />
Who live near by, were there that night,<br />
Contributing the keen delight<br />
Of beauty, so to speak.<br />
<br />
Oh bachelors, how sweet to glide<br />
With such bright charmers by one's side!<br />
And ev'ry heart a surging tide<br />
Of leap-year sentiment!<br />
You might perambulate around<br />
Until you'd hear the trumpet sound&mdash;<br />
No better quarters could be found<br />
To pitch your earthly tent.<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span><br />
At 12 o'clock the ladies came<br />
And took each blushing(?) humbled swain<br />
Across the road, where Eddie's dame<br />
Had placed a royal feast.<br />
Each charmer paid (alas how rare!)<br />
Her own and hungry fellow's fare,<br />
And splendid food was furnished there<br />
For o'er an hour at least.<br />
<br />
We must congratulate each belle<br />
From mountain, vale and Fisher Hill,<br />
Who paid her leap-year tax so well<br />
Last Friday night at Gould.<br />
Had we our wish we'd gladly call<br />
Twice yearly for a leap-year ball,<br />
For surely we were happy all<br />
The while the women ruled.<br />
<br />
And we beseech you throw your charms<br />
Around the lonely mountain farms,<br />
Where bachelors are up in arms<br />
Against your luring spell.<br />
Fan to a flame the sluggish smoke,<br />
Place Gibourd in a double yoke,<br />
And give friend Finlay Ian a poke<br />
To keep him hale and well.<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span><br />
Dear girls, keep up your enterprise<br />
And dazzle all those "bache's" eyes,<br />
Before the present leap-year dies<br />
And robs you of your rights.<br />
Take pity on the lonely men<br />
From "Midnight" to big corner "Ken,"<br />
Or later on "it might have been"<br />
Will rob your sleep o' nights.<br />
<br />
The 'legibles we'll briefly scan:<br />
There's Merchant Donald B. Buchan,<br />
Who is a dear, good-natured man,<br />
And not too old to mend;<br />
And Layfield, too, by George! you bet,<br />
A closer friend it's hard to get&mdash;<br />
Besiege their hearts, they're both to let,<br />
And bliss will rule the end.<br />
<br />
And finally O'Norman "Hoe",<br />
Can Cupid's dart e'er conquer you,<br />
And penetrate your bosom through<br />
To kindle there a flame?<br />
Shall living mortal ever see<br />
A bouncing baby on your knee<br />
Whose lisping tones will add with glee<br />
"Papa" unto your name.<br />

<h2>HOW WE SETTLED THE ALASKAN<br />
BOUNDARY QUESTION</h2>

<div class="blockquot"><p>These lines were penned long before the breaking out
of the present great war. Note the remarkable spirit of
prophesy which pervaded the poem, especially its allusion
to the Armenians.</p></div>


<div class='poem'>
Now that little Venezuela<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Has her navy back in tow,</span><br />
With the "allies" in the distance<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Waiting for the promised "dough",</span><br />
It may not be deemed improper<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">For the mind that loves to roam,</span><br />
Just to focus its attention<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">On some matters nearer home.</span><br />
<br />
We are also growing weary<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Of the "war clouds in the East",</span><br />
Which bob up to entertain us<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Once or twice a year at least.</span><br />
And we'd bear the "bobbing" better<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">If it did not always bring</span><br />
To the "concert of the Powers"<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">An unfailing chance to sing.</span><br />
<br />
They are masterful musicians<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">With chin music as their forte,</span><br />
And a penchant strong for love songs<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">When they serenade the Porte!</span><br />
While they sing the Sultan dances<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Like a strolling Dago's bear,</span><br />
Till one really feels the presence<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Of roast Turkey in the air!</span><br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span><br />
Thus they exorcise the spirit<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Of destruction in the Turk,</span><br />
And adjure the imp to vamoose<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And forego its bloody work.</span><br />
Doth he vamoose? Yes, a season,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">To return with "seven more,"</span><br />
While the Sultan's still insultin'<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And his fingers still in gore.</span><br />
<br />
But we'll leave this doubtful concert<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And its harem-scarem tones,</span><br />
Meant to drown the voice appealing<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">In the dying Christian's groans;</span><br />
And examine rather closer<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Into troubles of our own.</span><br />
To uproot the crops of mischief<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Which old Satan may have sown.</span><br />
<br />
People must with friendly feelings,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And the best intentions, try</span><br />
To elucidate the muddle<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Termed "Alaskan boundary."</span><br />
There's a rumble in that region,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And it shouldn't louder grow&mdash;</span><br />
Just a little cloud of worry<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">'Mid the flurry of the snow.</span><br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span><br />
Why, oh why, should kindred people<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Quarrel over hunks of ice?</span><br />
If they knew each other better<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">They would settle in a trice.</span><br />
But Miss Canada is frigid<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And Columbia is cold,</span><br />
So in presence of the couple<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">There's an iciness untold.</span><br />
<br />
Harken to the one bemoaning<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Up among the northern lights,</span><br />
How that 'tother is a "squatter"<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And encroaching on her rights.</span><br />
"It is mine by deed and title,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">For as everybody knows&mdash;</span><br />
Not to mention Rudyard Kipling&mdash;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">I am 'Lady of the Snows'.</span><br />
<br />
"See my cousin, Hail Columbia,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Who has settled thereabout,</span><br />
She will soon take Root and Lodge there<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">If I do not Turner<a name="FNanchor_C_3" id="FNanchor_C_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_C_3" class="fnanchor">[C]</a> out.</span><br />
When I asked her 'please to vacate',<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Can you guess the jade's response?</span><br />
Why, she sweetly smiled and answered,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">'After you, my dear Alphonse'!"</span><br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span><br />
Thus the question rests at present,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Till the arbitrators meet;</span><br />
And we trust when said time cometh<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">They will gravely take their seat</span><br />
Near the base of all the trouble,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">On the apex of the Pole,</span><br />
Where they'll exercise the virtue<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">At the least of keeping cool!</span><br />
<br />
Furl your "colors," then, ye fair ones,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">In a truce of amity,</span><br />
Till this august body settles<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Where the "boundary" should be;</span><br />
We've emerged from clouds of discord<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And should never more go back</span><br />
Whether Skagway's 'neath Old Glory<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Or beneath the Union Jack!</span><br />

<h2>THE LUMBERJACK<br />
&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;</h2>


<div class='poem'>
We have songs on many topics,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">New and old, beneath the sun,</span><br />
But, alas, in many cases,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Minstrelsy is overdone;</span><br />
<br />
So I'll sing a song of labor&mdash;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Where the muse is rather slack&mdash;</span><br />
And my theme shall be of timber<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And the hardy lumberjack.</span><br />
<br />
Now republican traditions<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Are so grafted in our bones,</span><br />
That e'en monarchs of the forest<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Must be tumbled from their thrones.</span><br />
<br />
And to raze those ancient strongholds<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">We have armies of the axe,</span><br />
Plucky pioneers of progress,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Known to all as lumberjacks.</span><br />
<br />
He may lack the wings of angels<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And the sanctity of saints:</span><br />
If a town's in need of painting<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">He may furnish all the paints.</span><br />
<br />
Yet he lapses but a moment<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And again he hies him back</span><br />
Close unto the heart of nature,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Does the lonesome lumberjack.</span><br />
<br />
There amid his wild surroundings<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And the crooning of the trees,</span><br />
He finds balm for mind and body<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Borne on every passing breeze.</span><br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span><br />
There is something strangely healing<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">In the magic of the myrrh,</span><br />
In the odor of the cedar<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And the fragrance of the fir!</span><br />
<br />
Grind your axes, O my heroes,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Point your peavies, file your saws;</span><br />
Let your ropes and chains and cables<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Be examined now for flaws.</span><br />
<br />
Fire up the iron donkey,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Till each rivet feels the strain,</span><br />
Lumberjack has had his outing<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And returns to camp again!</span><br />
<br />
There is music in the axe fall<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">As it sounds upon the ear;</span><br />
There is music in the sawing<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">When the dust is flying clear&mdash;</span><br />
<br />
Aye, there's music for the lumberjack<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Magnificent of sound,</span><br />
In the crashing of the timber<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">As it thunders to the ground.</span><br />
<br />
He will never lack for music<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">While the owl is keeping time</span><br />
With the ceaseless serenading<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Of the frog within the slime.</span><br />
<br />
But the music ever sounding,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">With the sweetest of appeals,</span><br />
Is the ding-dong of the iron gong<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">That calls him to his meals!</span><br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span><br />
He's a credit to his calling,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">To his country and his clan:</span><br />
There is not a dude among them&mdash;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Every lumberjack's a man.</span><br />
<br />
And you'll find him ever cheerful,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">In the sunshine or the rain,</span><br />
From the camps of B. Columbia<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">To the lumber camps of Maine.</span><br />
<br />
He may show a rough exterior,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">But his heart is warm within&mdash;</span><br />
Mark him poring o'er that letter,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Just received from home and kin:</span><br />
<br />
Tears will gather hot and blinding<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And he cannot hold them back,</span><br />
Reading words from distant loved ones<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">to their absent lumberjack!</span><br />
<br />
'Tis, perchance, a loving message<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">From a sweetheart far away,</span><br />
Or a tender admonition<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">From a mother old and gray.</span><br />
<br />
O, ye lumberjacks, remember,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">That wherever ye may roam,</span><br />
There are anxious hearts awaiting<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">For an answer "back at home"!</span><br />
<br />
When the sun in golden glory<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Hath descended in the west,</span><br />
They indulge in song and story<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Till they seek their bunks for rest:</span><br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span><br />
There to dream of scenes of childhood,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Amid mountain stream or glen,</span><br />
Till old Sol in morning splendor<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Calls them to their tasks again.</span><br />
<br />
Soft and soothing are the voices<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">As the shades of evening fall,</span><br />
Stealing gently through the forest&mdash;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Brooding calmly over all.</span><br />
<br />
By yon lake a loon is calling<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And the night bird answers back,</span><br />
Keeping vigil o'er the slumbers<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Of the weary lumberjack.</span><br />
<br />
O, the lumberjack is loyal<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And he'll surely see to it,</span><br />
In the grind against the Kaiser<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">That each axe will "do its bit";</span><br />
<br />
He will spruce up for the allies<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Till ten thousand airplanes hum,</span><br />
All to win the war for freedom<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And democracy, by gum!</span><br />
</div>


<div class='center'><br />Chorus<br /><br /></div>

Grind your axes, O my heroes,<br />

<div class='poem'><br />
The sun rose in splendor one foine summer morning<br />
That marked me first effort at selling a book.<br />
It's rays with soft beauty the landscape adorning<br />
Sint thramps to seek bliss in some cool shady nook.<br />
But no such rethrate the hot moments beguiling<br />
Afforded relief to poor Pathrick O'Reilly,<br />
Who canvassed that day epidermis parboiling<br />
In air that would stifle a Florida cook.<br />
<br />
I ambled along wid me pack on me shoulder,<br />
And prayed for a cloud to o'ershadow me path:<br />
Says I to meself, if it doesn't grow cowlder<br />
Poor Pat you'll be afther sure milting to death.<br />
I entered a town an' the first house I came to<br />
Looked much loike O'Grady's, I intered the same to,<br />
And called for the misthress, though troth half ashamed to,<br />
An' sat for a moment to catch at me breath.<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span><br />
Be the council o' Cork I was not long awaiting,<br />
The misthress appeared, looking black as a rook.<br />
"The devil ye are wid yer impertince satin,<br />
Yerself in me kitchen," she said wid a look.<br />
Says I, "How is your rheumatiz, Mrs. O'Grady?"<br />
And then quite politely I asked, "Can ye rade ye<br />
Ould hathen, if not be me troth ye are nady;<br />
Ye want to be afther sure buyin' a book."<br />
<br />
She looked quite intint at aich bould handsome fature,<br />
And warm as it was, I could see that she shook.<br />
"O'll tache ye a lesson," she scramed, "Ye vile crature,<br />
Ye cross twixt an ape an' a Bowery street crook!"<br />
She jumped at me troat thin an' would you belave me,<br />
As quick as a wink through the dure did she have me,<br />
And howled as I struck&mdash;will her tones ever lave me?&mdash;<br />
"The divil fly off wid yerself an' yer book."<br />
<br />
I left a square inch of me cheek at O'Grady's,<br />
An' limped wid the rest to the house just fornint.<br />
A winch in the dureway was paling some praties,<br />
Who watched me approach wid a quizzical squint.<br />
Says I wid the best of me Chesterfield graces,<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span>"Good day me fair maid, ain't it hotter than blazes,"<br />
An' coaxingly swate I did ask, "If ye plaze, Miss,<br />
To ordher a piece av me illigant print!"<br />
<br />
Thank God for his gifts! this colleen was a daisy,<br />
Who flashed me a glance from her eyes of deep blue;<br />
And smiling so swately said, "Pathrick, go aisy,<br />
I see ye were born where the blarney stone grew."<br />
"O yes, I was born in ould Ireland, God bless ye,<br />
The compliment sure makes me long to caress ye,<br />
And now be me troth I am timpted to press ye<br />
To take all me books an' the book agent too!"<br />
<br />
We published the bans then to tell Oi'm not minding,<br />
Our lips did the printing as ach wint to press&mdash;<br />
The type was O. K. and O. K. was the binding,<br />
The sthrongest av bonds are two hearts that caress.<br />
The saints be adored for the joys they were sending&mdash;<br />
The angels be bless'd on our nuptials attending&mdash;<br />
For nothing can aquel in loife till its ending<br />
The gift of a mate loike the wan I possess!<br />

<h2>GUARD THE GAELIC<br />
An Exhortation to the Gael.<br />
&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;</h2>


<div class='poem'>
Is it not our bounden right<br />
To uphold with all our might,<br />
And with tongue and pen to fight<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">For our native Gaelic?</span><br />
<br />
Guard the language known to Eve,<br />
Ere the Serpent did deceive&mdash;<br />
And the last one we believe,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Mellow, matchless Gaelic!</span><br />
<br />
Pity the disloyal clown<br />
Who will dwell awhile in Town,<br />
And returning wear a frown<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">If he hears the Gaelic.</span><br />
<br />
'Tis amusing to behold<br />
Little misses ten years old,<br />
When they leave the country fold<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">How they lose the Gaelic.</span><br />
<br />
Some gay natives of the soil,<br />
Cross "the line" a little while<br />
And returning, deem it "style"<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span><span style="margin-left: 1em;">To deny the Gaelic.</span><br />
<br />
Lads and lassies in their teens<br />
Wearing airs of kings and queens&mdash;<br />
Just a taste of Boston beans<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Makes them lose their Gaelic!</span><br />
<br />
They return with finer clothes,<br />
Speaking "Yankee" through their nose!<br />
That's the way the Gaelic goes&mdash;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Pop! goes the Gaelic.</span><br />
<br />
Tho' the so-called "tony set"<br />
Teach them quickly to forget,<br />
They will all be loyal yet<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">To their mother Gaelic.</span><br />
<br />
Then abjure such silly pride<br />
Cast the ragged thing aside&mdash;<br />
Let your mongrel "English" slide<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Rather than the Gaelic.</span><br />
<br />
What a dire calamity<br />
And how lonesome we would be<br />
If our honored Seannachie,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Failed to charm in Gaelic!</span><br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span><br />
Better far the "mother tongue"&mdash;<br />
Language in which mother sung<br />
Long ago, when we were young&mdash;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Ever tender Gaelic!</span><br />
<br />
Findlay's ever ready muse,<br />
Stricken dumb, would soon refuse<br />
People further to enthuse,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">If he lost his Gaelic!</span><br />
<br />
And Buchanan, how could he<br />
Sell his soda or his tea<br />
On this side of "Talamh a righ,"<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">If he lost his Gaelic?</span><br />
<br />
Also Merchant Edward Mac<br />
Would not sell so much tomac<br />
If his stock was found to lack<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Lusty Lewis Gaelic!</span><br />
<br />
And Pennoyer, what would you<br />
At the Gould post office do<br />
When you'd hear from not a few<br />
"Ca mar u ha u fean a diubh,"<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span><span style="margin-left: 1em;">If you lost your Gaelic?</span><br />
<br />
Little Donald with the plaid<br />
O'er his buirdly shoulder laid,<br />
Would go dancing in the shade,<br />
And his glory soon would fade<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">If he lost his Gaelic.</span><br />
<br />
From O'Groat's to <ins title="Transcriber's Note: original reads 'lands'end'">lands' end</ins>, too,<br />
What would brother Scotsmen do&mdash;<br />
All the loyal clansmen who<br />
But a single language know,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">If they lost their Gaelic?</span><br />
<br />
What would then become of those<br />
Poems grand, in rhyme or prose,<br />
Which in stately measure flows<br />
From "Beinn Oran's" spotless snows!<br />
"Chaibar Faidth"&mdash;the best that grows&mdash;<br />
"Fhir a baitha"&mdash;how he rows!<br />
What, I ask, would happen those<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">If we lost the Gaelic?</span><br />
<br />
Then uphold the magic tongue<br />
Which through mystic Eden rung<br />
When Creation still was young&mdash;<br />
Language in which Adam sung<br />
To his Eve, Earth's first love song;<br />
When the morning stars were flung<br />
Into space, where since they've clung&mdash;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Ancient, Glorious Gaelic!</span><br />

O, the outlook from his aerie is a grand one, it is true&mdash;<br />
Matchless beauty in the vistas which unfold before his view;<br />
Might and right and wealth and glory that shall never know decline<br />
Are his attributes to conquer ruthless robbers of the Rhine!<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a></span><br />
You invaded his dominions, sowing discord on the way;<br />
Your besotted agents plotted to o'erthrow his mighty sway:<br />
Using all the wiles of Willie on pacifist Bob and Pat,<br />
Till some eaglets oversilly scarcely knew where they were at.<br />

He was patient with your pirates since you first began to raid<br />
And usurp his habitation to pursue your hell-born trade;<br />
He was patient with your plotting till you piled the final straws<br />
Which broke down his toleration&mdash;now, ye devils, mind his claws!<br />
<br />
He looked on in consternation, scarce believing what he saw.<br />
When you sank his ships in anger in defiance of all law:<br />
Killing women and their children with a fiendishness unknown<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span>Since the first bloodthirsty monster was misplaced upon a throne.<br />
<br />
Now the eagle's wrath is burning, he is eager for the fray,<br />
And the robbers who aroused him long will rue the bitter day<br />
When he sweeps down from his aerie in the fury of his fire&mdash;<br />
Sudden death will clutch the vitals of the victims of his ire!<br />
<br />
Yea, the eagle's wings are spreading, nobly spreading to the breeze,<br />
And their awful sweep shall bear him over land and over seas:<br />
Men and money move in millions where those mighty pinions rest,<br />
And God help misguided minions who have monkeyed with his nest!<br />
<br />
Brave, determined northern neighbor, hold the "hills" so dearly won&mdash;<br />
Hold the hills until the Eagle strikes with you to crush the Hun!<br />
Courage! Allies, friends of freedom, in this war we're all akin&mdash;<br />
Carry on! Old Glory's with you on the red road to Berlin!<br />

<h2>IN MEMORY<br />
of<br />
DONALD McLEOD</h2>

<div class='center'>&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;</div>
<div class="blockquot"><p>Of North Hill, Lingwick, Who Died of Smallpox, at Flagstaff,
Arizona, on the 2nd day of March, 1882.</p></div>
<div class='center'>&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;<br /><br /></div>


<div class='poem'>
The sun hath set and leaves the day, as when the soul hath left its clay,<br />
The pale soft tints of twilight spread from east to west.<br />
The evening breeze that fans my cheek with mellow cadence seems to speak,<br />
Then sighing onward through the dusk it sinks to rest.<br />
<br />
On nights like this my fancy strays, to loved ones lost in other days;<br />
Whom gold had tempted to the sunset land afar;<br />
Brave boys whose hopes of future wealth were blasted by thy power O Death,<br />
Whose mandates wage on old and young a constant war.<br />
Among the lads so kind and true, who sought the land of golden hue,<br />
To meet amid its glittering hopes an early doom,<br />
Was Lingwick's strongest, lealest man, the joy and pride of all his clan,<br />
As brave a youth as ever graced a Compton home.<br />
<br />
Dear comrade of my younger days, my muse is weak to sing thy praise,<br />
But love is strong howe'er so feeble be my strain;<br />
And though you're sleeping cold and still, on Flagstaff's distant pine-clad hill,<br />
Fond memory often flits to thee across the plain.<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span><br />
I loved e'er childhood's days were passed: I'll love you on until the last;<br />
E'en when the clouds of death approach I'll think of thee;<br />
Oh, bitter fate! Oh, woeful hour! that cut thee down in manhood's power;<br />
Thrice bitter if death's chains could bind eternally.<br />
<br />
But blessed promise, hopeful friend, that tells us death is not the end,<br />
That brighter prospects loom for all beyond the wave.<br />
Oh, sing aloud the glad refrain, that friend with friend will meet again!<br />
For love like this can ne'er be conquered by the grave.<br />
<br />
What though the red men roam at will, from arid plain to cooler hill,<br />
Regardless of the mounds that lie amid the groves:<br />
What though our children find their graves with ghosts of long departed braves,<br />
The spot is one the God of nature dearly loves.<br />
<br />
In Arizona's distant land, where cyclones drift the heated sand,<br />
And where the tall, majestic pine tree branches wave;<br />
Where gaunt coyotes prowl for prey, through storm and calm, by night and day,<br />
There in their midst there lies a lone, neglected grave.<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a></span><br />
Were eloquence immortal mine I'd sing of scenes the most sublime,<br />
Of any nature ever lavished here below.<br />
God's majesty seems here unfurled as <ins title="Transcriber's Note: original reads 'elewhere'">elsewhere</ins> not in all the world,&mdash;<br />
An earthly paradise o'erspread by heaven's glow.<br />
<br />
How fitting that thy sun went down, so near the spot that wears earth's crown,&mdash;<br />
The Colorado Canyon country, weird and dim;<br />
No grander land beneath the skies in which to die, in which to rise;<br />
And nature's God will care for all who sleep in Him.<br />
<br />
What though, alas, fond earthly hopes are buried in yon western slopes,<br />
And gentle mothers grieve for loved ones lying there:<br />
Though maidens sigh with sad unrest, for lovers true who died out west;<br />
The bitter heartache soon will cease and all be fair.<br />
<br />
But Donald's manly voice still rings within our ears, and memory clings<br />
To all the charms that marked his life while still below:<br />
And often now our fancy's flight doth wing its journey to that night,<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span>That marks his lonely death amid the mountain snow.<br />
<br />
The prairie wolves of stealthy tread already seemed to scent the dead;<br />
Their fitful howls were borne upon the midnight air;<br />
The western world was wrapped in gloom, from sandy waste to heaven's dome,<br />
When Donald closed his weary eyes and passed from care.<br />
<br />
The air within the mountain camp was uncongenial, cold and damp:<br />
And springtide gales were moaning dismally outside:<br />
No loving hand was there to press his fevered brow with fond caress,<br />
No gentle voice to whisper comfort when he died.<br />
<br />
Dear Balloch Ban, thou'rt now at rest; thy sun went down far in the West.<br />
Alas! no more to rise, until the Judgment Day;<br />
No truer heart e'er ceased to beat, no braver soul O Death did greet,<br />
Thy awful presence since the earth hath owned thy sway.<br />
<br />
And now he sleeps beneath the sod, where grand old mountain pine trees nod<br />
Their lofty plumes beneath the far-off, distant dome!<br />
Oh, stranger, should you linger near, drop on this lonely grave a tear,<br />
In memory of the boy that sleeps so far from home.<br />

<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Bright gem from Britain's crown&mdash;</span><br />
Assailed by Huns with gas and guns<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">In "No Man's Land" was down.</span><br />
<br />
No power on earth can save him,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">'Tis madness, then, to try;</span><br />
Still to the deed sprang forth with speed<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">A balloch ban from Skye!</span><br />
<br />
He volunteered to enter<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">That zone of certain death,</span><br />
And unafraid went forth to aid,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">While thousands held their breath.</span><br />
<br />
Thru all that hell of fire<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">He sped like mountain deer&mdash;</span><br />
On shell-torn ground his comrade found,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And bore him to the rear.</span><br />
<br />
Their comrades gather 'round them<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">To do what mortals can:</span><br />
But&mdash;cruel fate!&mdash;they found them<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Beyond the help of man.</span><br />

How marred the manly beauty!<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Now torn by shot and shell&mdash;</span><br />
Ye Huns have done your duty<br />

<br />
Over the top together!<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Out from the fighting list:</span><br />

<h2>THE <ins title="Transcriber's Note: original reads 'ALKILI'">ALKALI</ins> LAND<br />

or<br />

A-ROAMING I WOULD GO.<br />
&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;</h2>


<div class='poem'>
I left my old home and my friends in the East,<br />
Ambitious to better my fortunes, forsooth;<br />
And seek amid scenes of the strenuous West,<br />
The gold which had gilded the dreams of my youth.<br />
<br />
But gold not alone, was the dochus mo chree<br />
Which painted that faraway country so fair;<br />
A lure more compelling was beckoning me&mdash;<br />
The maiden I loved since my childhood was there!<br />
<br />
I did what a man without money must do,<br />
Just walked when the "brakies" were looking too sharp.<br />
I sang when I felt in the humor, 'tis true&mdash;<br />
When lonesome, like David I hung up my harp!<br />
<br />
I envied the lot of the fellow inside,<br />
Who traveled in comfort asleep or awake;<br />
While I, of all comfort and slumber denied,<br />
Was beating my way on the beam of a brake!<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[131]</a></span><br />
Thus onward I journeyed by night and by day,<br />
Combating the problems of food and of rest&mdash;<br />
Content as I traveled the wearisome way<br />
To know I was nearing the wonderful West.<br />
<br />
My pilgrimage, first uneventful and slow,<br />
Changed color as Texas' vast reaches I struck.<br />
Arizona the arid, and New Mexico&mdash;<br />
Half hell and half heaven, were also my luck.<br />
<br />
When tortured and weak by the heat of the sand,<br />
And swollen my tongue and the water was done,<br />
I wondered no more as I passed through the land<br />
At the myriad bones bleaching white in the sun.<br />
<br />
Yes, on as I plodded the limitless range,<br />
In that land of hot sand and eternal clear skies,<br />
How oft in my thirst did I long for a change<br />
To my own native hills, where the watersprings rise!<br />
O Compton beloved! what visions arose,<br />
Of thy hills and dark vales and thy cold mountain streams!<br />
And each fountain-like fuadhran<a name="FNanchor_D_4" id="FNanchor_D_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_D_4" class="fnanchor">[D]</a> which bubbles and flows,<br />
On the farm back at home in the land of my dreams!<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[132]</a></span><br />
Some tell me the beauty of Nature, abroad,<br />
Surpasses in grandeur the country we boast&mdash;<br />
They'd alter their views if they traversed the road<br />
I wearily tramped on my way to the "Coast".<br />
<br />
There may be a spot in some faraway clime<br />
Where Nature in robes of perfection is dressed;<br />
But give me her moods and her image sublime<br />
As seen in the wild, woolly wastes of the West!<br />
<br />
I slept with the red men who roam through that land&mdash;<br />
Gaunt remnant that tells of the white man's abuse;<br />
And often, although I could not understand,<br />
Was I lulled by the soft clucking language they use.<br />
<br />
We never took thought on occasions like these<br />
Of the dangers which lurked as we lay on the ground&mdash;<br />
Though the howl of coyote was borne past on the breeze,<br />
And the rattlesnake coiled with an ominous sound!<br />
<br />
Asleep 'neath the stars of that beautiful clime,<br />
In the shadowy gloom that same mesa had cast,<br />
Undisturbed in my slumbers, I'd dream of the time<br />
When the long dreary miles still ahead would be passed.<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[133]</a></span><br />
Mysterious mesas! how ghostly ye loom!<br />
How spectral and huge o'er the alkali waste;<br />
The secrets of ages thy vastness entomb,<br />
Are seemingly safe in thy mystical breast!<br />
<br />
When shadows of even' crept over the land,<br />
And mountains around me grew ghostly and grey,<br />
The fringe of the foothills I anxiously scanned<br />
For lithe, tawny forms ever prowling for prey.<br />
<br />
Oft during my journey I fancied that rain<br />
Fell cool from a cloud on my thirst-swollen lips;<br />
Yet cloudless the sky o'er that quivering plain&mdash;<br />
'Twas the last ray of hope undergoing eclipse!<br />
<br />
At times would the lure of this mirage prevail,<br />
Till, reason returning, I'd hasten me back;<br />
For I knew the safe trail was to follow the rail<br />
Gleaming hot in the sun on the Santa Fe track!<br />
<br />
The phantoms of fever thus beckoned in vain,<br />
Where better and stronger than I had been lost;<br />
Though the hell of Mohave was scorching my brain,<br />
I crossed it in safety and struck for the Coast.<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[134]</a></span><br />
O boundless Pacific! I deem it no loss<br />
To flee to thy arms from the cactus and sand;<br />
How sweet on thy deep, heaving bosom to toss<br />
After parching so long in the alkali land!<br />
<br />
I boarded a schooner that slopped in the bay&mdash;<br />
A tub of a ship for Seattle outbound&mdash;<br />
And up from old Frisco we wallowed our way<br />
To lovely Seattle, the Queen of the Sound.<br />
<br />
And there on a hill, in a beautiful spot,<br />
Overlooking Lake Union's low murmuring wave,<br />
The love of my youth, whom so long I had sought,<br />
Alone among strangers I found&mdash;in her grave!<br />

<h2>A CHRISTMAS DREAM.<br />
&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;</h2>


<div class='poem'>
On Christmas night I sallied forth,<br />
To the Red Mountain in the north;<br />
The bright abode of men of worth<br />
'Twixt here and heaven;<br />
Where Finlay's stakes in mother earth<br />
Are firmly driven.<br />
<br />
I ambled up the village road,<br />
Past many an Irishman's abode,<br />
And carried quite a heavy load&mdash;<br />
The most inside;<br />
I faith sincerely thanked the code<br />
The way was wide.<br />
<br />
Here conscience loudly whispered, "Dhu,<br />
How oft hath it been told to you,<br />
The end that way would lead you to<br />
Should you persist&mdash;<br />
With soldiers of the ribbon blue<br />
At once enlist."<br />
<br />
I answered conscience, "give me peace,<br />
The time of pledges draws apace,<br />
When we must swear to shun the glass<br />
And all its riot;<br />
We've but a single week of grace<br />
So let's enjoy it."<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[136]</a></span><br />
I followed up by Keenan's gate<br />
Unto the "turn" where two ways meet,<br />
Thence to the left the mountain street<br />
Would guide me right,<br />
Tho' for my life I could not see't,<br />
Just in that light.<br />
<br />
For where two highways ran before,<br />
I saw a dozen tracks or more;<br />
And which to take, I wasn't sure,<br />
By either eye;<br />
'Twas but a chance against a score,<br />
And yet I'd try.<br />
<br />
I started on with divers tacks,<br />
And strove to reconcile the tracks<br />
Which darted round, like jumping jacks,<br />
Before my gaze;<br />
'Twould take a dozen crowd a cacks<br />
Their course to trace.<br />
<br />
Had I big John's and Eddie's charts,<br />
To tell me where the highway parts,<br />
Reducing by their magic arts<br />
Nineteen to two;<br />
I would have from my heart of hearts<br />
Poured blessings due.<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[137]</a></span><br />
Confusion worse confounded, gee!<br />
On every track a horse I see,<br />
And all alike it seems to me<br />
As barley scones&mdash;<br />
I vow, Pete Gagne's cavalry&mdash;<br />
Proud, prancing roans!<br />
<br />
Their bones were rattling in the cold<br />
Like vales of which Ezekiel told!<br />
A few indeed did seem too old<br />
To nibble corn;<br />
The colt among them all was foaled<br />
Ere "Smoke" was born.<br />
<br />
Ah! crippled, gaunt and wild-eyed steed,<br />
Thy woes are great, your want is feed!<br />
Reminds me of D. Bunker's breed<br />
That gasps for breath;<br />
Aye, one and all are built for speed&mdash;<br />
To certain death!<br />
<br />
I asked the leader of the band,<br />
If he could tell, upon which hand,<br />
The mountain turnpike pierced the land<br />
Around those parts;<br />
I'd shipped a sea, I told him, and<br />
Had lost my charts.<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[138]</a></span><br />
"The left!" he answered with a yell;<br />
"Tis easy, sir, your course to tell;<br />
And that will lead you down to&mdash;well,<br />
To "Robert's road."<br />
Then straight away on yonder hill<br />
Is "Smoke's" abode.<br />
<br />
"The right hand road you must not take,<br />
As that will lead to Moffat Lake,<br />
Where Cookshire sportsmen saw "big snake"<br />
Through Alden's glass.<br />
And thots of serpents make me quake<br />
From head to cass."<br />
<br />
I gave my guide a social wink,<br />
And started on, is cha ro blink,<br />
Till my exuberance, I think,<br />
Broke into song:<br />
I said "good evening" to the "Mink,"<br />
And passed along.<br />
<br />
The air was keen, the night was bright,<br />
And in the north that mystic light,<br />
(In my exaggerated sight)<br />
Was one to please;<br />
The whole suggested yellow, white<br />
Or greenish cheese!<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[139]</a></span><br />
I gained momentum down the ridge,<br />
And jumped John Moggish's hump-backed bridge;<br />
Then climbed the mountain, hedge by hedge,<br />
Unto the crest.<br />
And thought it there my privilege<br />
To take a rest.<br />
<br />
I could not find the mountain store<br />
Which Channel mentioned in his leor,<br />
My vision's better than before,<br />
I really think:<br />
Aye, C&mdash;&mdash; accounts for one or more&mdash;<br />
And he don't drink.<br />
<br />
But stores aside, I wandered on<br />
To where the school house windows shone,<br />
Altho' there seemed to me but one&mdash;<br />
A dancing glare:<br />
I thought the northern lights were on<br />
The programme there.<br />
<br />
And just within, O "hully gee!"<br />
Is that a single Christmas tree,<br />
Or is my vision still aglee?<br />
For lack of breath&mdash;<br />
A moving forest do I see<br />
As saw Macbeth?<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[140]</a></span><br />
And better still the forest gleams<br />
With all a youngster most esteems:<br />
A greater crop, as groaning beams<br />
Did there attest<br />
Than Tupper saw in wildest dreams<br />
Of wheat out West.<br />
<br />
And bachelors (might they be fewer)!<br />
I thought I'd see you single, sure,<br />
But there they sit, at least a score,<br />
On benches stuck;<br />
Each one a wilted, lone wall flower<br />
Awaiting pluck.<br />
<br />
We pray you, O assultin Turk,<br />
So noted for unholy work,<br />
To send his devilship your clerk<br />
Across the seas:<br />
To drive our single men to kirk<br />
With marriage fees.<br />
<br />
Or send Armenians not yet dead<br />
And take our bachelors instead;<br />
Should you then hanker for their head<br />
Just plant their hide:<br />
And thus avoid that hellish dread<br />
Infanticide!<br />

Behold! I've reason now to stare!<br />
For are there not two Finlays there&mdash;<br />
And only one on earth I swear&mdash;<br />
Come off my hat!<br />
A worthier to fill a chair<br />
Has never sat.<br />
<br />
Red Mountain, thy neglect condone&mdash;<br />
Within that "chair" your bard enthrone:<br />
Instead of bread, don't give a stone<br />
As others do&mdash;<br />
Another Finlay like your own<br />
You'll never know.<br />
<br />
Sweet singer! may your mother tongue,<br />
Embellished by thy gift of song,<br />
Be ever heard the clans among<br />
While print is read&mdash;<br />
May future bards thy notes prolong<br />
When thou art dead.<br />
<br />
Thus on and on, while cycles roll,<br />
May Gaelic&mdash;language of the soul&mdash;<br />
Be heard in song from pole to pole,<br />
From east to west,<br />
Until the final tempests bowl<br />
This earth to rest!<br />

Concluding&mdash;I would humbly ask<br />
All hypocrites to shun the task<br />
Of shooting from behind a mask<br />
Their fellow men&mdash;<br />
And help us all to fling our flask<br />
To Hinnom's glen!<br />
<br />
We've heard the loud, despairing moan<br />
Of sinners, reaping what they've sown,<br />
In midnight fields with thistles grown<br />
Where devils glean.<br />
Yet let the first to cast a stone<br />
Himself be clean.<br />
<br />
No living mortal can invite<br />
The gaze of creatures who delight<br />
In showing spots upon the white<br />
Which God hath gi'en.<br />
Alas, alas, a little spite<br />
Will find the stain.<br />
<br />
But who's to judge? The serpent's there,<br />
In every breast that breathes the air,<br />
Though some with skill and acting rare<br />
His form conceal;<br />
While others full to view must wear<br />
The squirming eel!<br />

<p>Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is

electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm

terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement

works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently

from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this

     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm

forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS,' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.gutenberg.org/fundraising/pglaf.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://www.gutenberg.org/fundraising/pglaf

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://www.gutenberg.org/fundraising/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Each eBook is in a subdirectory of the same number as the eBook's
eBook number, often in several formats including plain vanilla ASCII,
compressed (zipped), HTML and others.

Corrected EDITIONS of our eBooks replace the old file and take over
the old filename and etext number.  The replaced older file is renamed.
VERSIONS based on separate sources are treated as new eBooks receiving
new filenames and etext numbers.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

<a href="http://www.gutenberg.org">http://www.gutenberg.org</a>

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.

EBooks posted prior to November 2003, with eBook numbers BELOW #10000,
are filed in directories based on their release date.  If you want to
download any of these eBooks directly, rather than using the regular
search system you may utilize the following addresses and just
download by the etext year.

<a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/etext06/">http://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/etext06/</a>

    (Or /etext 05, 04, 03, 02, 01, 00, 99,
     98, 97, 96, 95, 94, 93, 92, 92, 91 or 90)

EBooks posted since November 2003, with etext numbers OVER #10000, are
filed in a different way.  The year of a release date is no longer part
of the directory path.  The path is based on the etext number (which is
identical to the filename).  The path to the file is made up of single
digits corresponding to all but the last digit in the filename.  For
example an eBook of filename 10234 would be found at:

http://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/1/0/2/3/10234

or filename 24689 would be found at:
http://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/2/4/6/8/24689
